From an early age, I’ve been captivated by the endless possibilities that computers offer. What started as a childhood curiosity for how they simplified complex tasks has flourished into a deep, lifelong passion. As I grew, this fascination turned into an unrelenting desire to understand more, motivating me to dive deeper into the world of technology and consistently excel beyond my peers. With every new discovery, I became increasingly drawn to the vast, untapped potential of the digital realm—a potential I knew I had to explore.

After completing my degree in Software Engineering at the prestigious University of Strathclyde in the United Kingdom, my journey is far from over. My passion for innovation continues to drive me, and I am now embarking on the next phase of my academic and professional path: pursuing a master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Monash University in Australia. This step not only reflects my dedication to the field but also symbolizes my commitment to mastering the technology that first ignited my curiosity.

What began as a simple interest has evolved into a powerful motivator for my ambitions. As I continue my journey, I look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead, eager to make my mark in the ever-changing world of technology.
