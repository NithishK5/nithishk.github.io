Hey! I’m Nithish Kumar Megarajan, a future-focused engineer with a passion for AI, clean design, and making ambitious things real.

Graduated from the University of Strathclyde, UK 🇬🇧
Currently pursuing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Monash University, Australia 🇦🇺
Creating tools, interfaces, and moments that feel like magic.

I’m driven by a curiosity to understand the world and reshape how people interact with tech. I enjoy crafting smooth user experiences, automating boring things, and diving deep into systems thinking.

You can find my [projects here](/projects) and [posts here](/posts).
More recently, I’ve been exploring AI productivity tools, startup ideas that scale, and how design can empower daily utility.

Outside of code, I lift, I explore cities, and I obsess over productivity, aesthetics, and food that slaps. 🍜
If you’re in Melbourne and down to chat AI, apps or espresso hit me up.
